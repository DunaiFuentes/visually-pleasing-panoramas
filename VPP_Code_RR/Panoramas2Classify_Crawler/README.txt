Use 'Panoramic_Camera_Crawler.m' to download the images that constitude Dataset IV from the camera website.

If you wish to perform your own labeling, script 'Voting.m' will allow you to do it. Otherwise the scores I gave are stored along with the data.

Finally, once you have the images and the 'list_with_scores' (yours or imported), you may proceed to create the training and test files with 'Create_train_test_5.m'.
